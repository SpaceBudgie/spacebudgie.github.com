					<h3>Description</h3>
					Here at Space Budgie, we want to create content that places a focus on games that can benefit people in some way. Our philosophies in game development are very much tied to the experimental games space. We want to create experiences that push games beyond an entertainment medium and into the realm of making them a force for real change in the world.
					<br/><br/>
					<h3>History</h3>
					Space Budgie's roots began at the University of Abertay, where all of the founders studied. We had all come from different backgrounds, but eventually all took part in Dare to be Digital 2012 as part of three different teams. At this point, we didn't all know each other. By the end of Dare to be Digital, we all became aquainted, and set out with the idea of starting a studio together. At this point we named ourselves Sink or Swim Games (partially because we were worried coming out of university and starting a studio). We later changed this to Space Budgie after an image we found of a budgie kitted out in a spacesuit which had some comedic value. <br/><br/> 
					We began conceptualising a game around the idea of the player being given the ability to edit the code in the game world. This ultimately became what Glitchspace is today. <br/><br/>
					After finishing our final year at the University of Abertay in 2013, one of our final year projects picked up some press - 9.03m. We dicussed and decided to polish the game up as a released title for Space Budgie - this was the point in which the seed was planted for us to take on our core company goal of creating meaningful content, that could benefit people in some way.<br/><br/>
					
					We took part in the 2013 7 Day FPS challenge making a game called No Way Out. This was partially as a way of working on a project together, but also to see if we could make something that could have some value. It ultimately ended up a big bag of features, but lacking a game. <br/><br/>
					
					By theee end of 2013, we had released 9.03m, got it Greenlit on Steam (with all of the fabulous support from the community and press!), had been nominated for two TIGA industry awards, and had been listed in Develop Magazines top 100 most exciting start ups in Europe. <br/><br/>
					
					Since then we have been working away on Glitchspace, released it in paid alpha, we were nominated for a Scottish New Talent Bafta, and also invited to talk about Glitchspace at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop as part of the 2014 Game Developers Conference.
